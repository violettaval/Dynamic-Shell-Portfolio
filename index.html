          Hi, I go by Violet nowadays. I am a youthful and nerdy 28 year old Latinx transwoman.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Minneapolis, Minnesota been living here almost all my life. 
        And love it here I enjoy the long summer days and cold winter scenery.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I have lots of hobbies from gathering collectibles, keeping up with the latest tv series and movies,
         to building with lego, and playing rpgs. I am deep in the nerd culture.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Games are my passion so programming video games would be nice. 
        I have not heard great things about the video game industry. So I would love to develop my own indie games and projects. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I just recently moved back to stay with my mom during the class. And still moving out from my old apartment.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I grew up as the internet has been evolving into its current state. I have always wanted to learn coding but have never had access to the resources. 
        None of my family has gone into the tech industry being the first means a lot to me. Also I feel like my relatives could benfit greatly from the skills I learn.
        Many of my cousins are starting their own businesses so being also to make their websites to support them would make me a good asset to the family.
      </p>
